### Purpose
Test the package details endpoint which provides detailed information about a specific PyPI package, including:
- Basic metadata (name, version, summary, etc.)
- Release history
- Maintenance scoring
- Repository links

### Happy Path Tests

  - Input: `{"package_name": "requests"}`
  - Expected:
    - Full package details
    - High maintenance score (likely >80)
    - Valid repository URL
    - Recent releases
  - Actual: [To be filled after testing]
  - Status: PENDING

- [ ] Test case 2: Get details for less active package
  - Input: `{"package_name": "some-older-package"}`
  - Expected:
    - Full package details
    - Lower maintenance score
    - Older release dates
  - Actual: [To be filled after testing]
  - Status: PENDING

### Sad Path Tests
- [ ] Test case 1: Empty package name
  - Input: `{"package_name": ""}`
  - Expected: InvalidParams error
  - Actual: [To be filled after testing]
  - Status: PENDING

- [ ] Test case 2: Missing package name
  - Input: `{}`
  - Expected: InvalidParams error
  - Actual: [To be filled after testing]
  - Status: PENDING

- [ ] Test case 3: Non-existent package
  - Input: `{"package_name": "this-package-does-not-exist-12345"}`
  - Expected: Package not found error
  - Actual: [To be filled after testing]
  - Status: PENDING

### Issues Found

### Notes
- Testing focuses on package details functionality
- Verifies maintenance score calculation
- Checks error handling
- Note: Package search is not supported by PyPI API, users should use pypi.org/search
